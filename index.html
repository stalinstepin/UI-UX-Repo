								<p>
								The Lord has a mission and is counting on each one of us to get it fulfilled - a mission to spread the light to every dark corner of the world. We must be ready to accept this call and go forward boldly. The Lord will equip us with His supreme power to overcome every obstacle. This is a world steeped in the darkness of sin. But we shall transform it into a beautiful place with the splendour of the light of Jesus. With that decision firm in our hearts, let us join hands with the Divine Youth and renew our commitment to be the missionaries of this new era.

				<h2>DIVINE YOUTH NOTE</h2>


				<p>Praise the Lord! Welcome to the DIVINE YOUTH website! 
				Jesus is alive! Our God is a consuming fire! This experience makes life worth living. 
				To convey this life-giving truth the Divine Youth exists. We are the praying community of youth at Divine Retreat Centre, the world’s largest Catholic Retreat Centre. We are young and strong because we live for Jesus. The Word of God says “Youth you are strong for the Word of God abides in you” (1 Jn 2:14). This is our strength and our passion – that we live, move and have our being in…. JESUS, The Word of God. For over 22 years now we’ve been holding retreats, discipleship programs & worship evenings - to pass on the fire of Jesus! Our mission: Building youth in Jesus for a commitment towards personal spirituality, life witness, evangelisation with the Church.
				Our dream is that every young person will come to get caught up in this fire of Jesus and so give light to the world, bring joy where there is sadness, hope where there are dead ends and love where there is emptiness. Come, share our dream and live the dream Jesus has for us!
