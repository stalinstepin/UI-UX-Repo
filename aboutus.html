						The Divine Youth is the youth wing of the Divine Retreat Centre, the world's largest Catholic retreat centre. Though the Divine Youth functions from this retreat centre in Kerala, their vision and work is rooted in the spiritual formation of the youth beyond boundaries.  
						The core of the Divine Youth is a community that lives, prays and works together in this retreat centre. Serving in different ministries such as the Divine television ministry and different retreat sections, they meet daily to pray, plan and organize youth renewal programmes at different levels. 
						The foundation of this service (as it is with the retreat centre) is the Vincentian Spirituality (of St Vincent de Paul). The youth are committed to evangelization and service of youth. 
						There is an international network that actively partners this mission of Divine Youth. This network includes young people who have experienced Jesus and are committed to bringing others to the experience of Christ. (For more details go to Join us page) 
						Special retreats for youth are held at the Divine retreat center. The National Youth Retreat (held twice a year) and the International Youth Retreat brings together thousands of youth from all over India and countries around the globe.

						Six young men from neighboring towns in Kerala participated in a retreat at the Divine Retreat Centre. Following this they started coming together every weekend to pray in a church or home or hall. At times when they could find no room, the meetings were held in some street corner. They felt more and more prompted to work to bring other young people like themselves to a real living experience of Jesus within the Church. It was around 1995 that these youngsters approached the Divine Retreat Centre to offer their services as the youth wing that came to be named as 'Divine Youth'.
						Since then the mighty and firm hand of God has been guiding the youth ministry to be His instrument to the draw the youth back to the heart and mission of Christ. Today the youth ministry has spread throughout India and beyond borders to other parts of the world.

						<strong>Bringing the best of Catholic worship to the cities.<br>
						An evening gathering held in various Indian cities, bringing the best of Catholic worship a 2-hour capsule
						with the celebration
						of the Holy Mass, Praise and Worship by one of the leading Catholic gospel bands, gospel message &  Eucharistic Adoration led by:</em><br>
						<br><em>
						Rev Fr Augustine Vallooran & <br>
						Rev Fr Jacob Arimpur<br><br>
						</em>
						</strong>
						It is the vision that God gave us to bring a regular renewal experience through an evening of "prayer with the sacraments" to the cities, for people facing the challenge of living their faith in a difficult culture. Magnificat is a 2 to 3 hour capsule that includes a time of praise and worship by a Catholic gospel choir followed by a gospel message and Eucharistic healing service led by Fr Augustine Vallooran or Fr Jacob Arimpur of Divine Retreat Centre. The goal of this program is to provide the renewal of faith and life values in this age to a generation faced by the difficult challenge of the selfish values of the consumerist culture. <br><br>

						Once a month we kindle the fire of faith offering an evening with the best form of worship. So some call it "the monthly booster dose of faith." It is for those who thirst and hunger for the word of God, and more so for those who are not able to feel the hunger and thirst. It is a venue to bring a friend to whom you can give a wonderful experience of faith. For many it is the arms of the Father where they can rest after a tiring battle.<br>  <br>
						It is now 8 years since Magnificat has been happening and we thank God for the lives He has touched and the hope He has given to thousands. Moreover Magnificat is being televised every week on Divine TV thereby many thousands more are being blessed by this evening of worship.<br><br>

						<strong>This program is held once a month in 2 cities of South India:<br></strong>


						<ol>
							<li>
								Bangalore - at the St. Joseph's Boy School, Museum Road from 5 to 8 pm. 
							</li>

							<li>
								Chennai - at St Teresa's Church, Nungambakkam from 5:30 to 8.30 pm.   
							</li>
